-->

- [ ] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/main/Contributing.md) document.
- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.
- [ ] I have confirmed that the link(s) in my PR is valid.
- [ ] I have signed off my commits. You can use `git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff` to amend an existing commit, and you can find more details about signing off commits on the DCO GitHub action page [here](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/)
- [ ] My entries are single lines and are in the appropriate (plugins, themes, or completions) section, and in alphabetical order in their section.
- [ ] Any added completions have a readme and a license file in their repository.
- [ ] Any added frameworks have a readme and a license file in their repository.
- [ ] Any added plugins have a readme and a license file in their repository.
- [ ] Any added themes have a screenshot, a readme, and a license file in their repository.
- [ ] I have stripped any leading and/or trailing **zsh-**, **zsh-plugin** and/or **oh-my-zsh-** substrings from the link name. This makes it easier to find plugins/themes/completions by name by preventing big clusters in the **O** and **Z** sections of the list.
